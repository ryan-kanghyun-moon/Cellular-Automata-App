# [Cellular Automata / Maze](https://ryan-kanghyun-moon.github.io/Cellular-Automata-App/)

## Inspiration:
Learning about cellular automata and facinated by how different rules result in different patterns (which was [experimented using python](https://github.com/ryan-kanghyun-moon/cellular-automata)), I thought it would be cool to create a tool where you create a maze yourself and also search through it.

## A Quick Demo:
**first make your maze...**

**then search through it!**

## What I Learned
* Arrays work very differently with js then other languages, and debugging was tricky because of this. I understand arrays are treated as objects now, so deepcopying should also be handled delicately.
* Planning file structures and decoupling components and styling makes development a lot more efficient. Not only should I picture how my app would look like but also the structure of the code should be well thought-out.
